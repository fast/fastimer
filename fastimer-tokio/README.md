The policy is that the minimum Rust version required to use this crate can be increased in minor version updates. For example, if Fastimer 1.0 requires Rust 1.20.0, then Fastimer 1.0.z for all values of z will also require Rust 1.20.0 or newer. However, Fastimer 1.y for y > 0 may require a newer minimum version of Rust.
